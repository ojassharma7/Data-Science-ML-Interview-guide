ML interview question : Explain proportional sampling with a toy example and write python code for the same toy example ?

Proportional sampling is a method where samples are drawn based on their proportional representation in the dataset. It ensures that categories with higher occurrences get proportionally more samples compared to less frequent categories.

Imagine a company receives customer complaints in different categories. To ensure fair representation, they want to randomly sample complaints while maintaining the original proportions of each issue type.

Let us assume the breakdown of complaints received in a month:
- Billing Issues: 40
- Poor Customer Support: 25
- Technical Problems: 20
- Late Delivery: 10
- Wrong Item Received: 5

Total Complaints = 100

If we need to sample 20 complaints, we allocate them proportionally:
- Billing Issues : (40/100) × 20 = 8
- Poor Customer Support : (25/100) × 20 = 5
- Technical Problems : (20/100) × 20 = 4
- Late Delivery : (10/100) × 20 = 2
- Wrong Item Received : (5/100) × 20 = 1

- Why does this matter?
 Proportional sampling ensures that common issues are well-represented while rarer complaints are not ignored. It’s widely used in machine learning datasets.
