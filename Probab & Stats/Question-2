 What is difference between correlation and covariance?

Correlation and covariance are both statistical measures used to describe the relationship between two variables, but they differ in several key aspects:

Covariance:
- cov(X,Y) = Expectation[ (X - mean_x)(Y - mean_y) ] 
- Measures how two variables change together. 
- Indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables
- Values range from -∞ to +∞
- Affected by the scale of the variables
- Difficult to interpret the strength of the relationship
- Not standardized
- Used in more advanced statistical analyses
- Helpful in understanding the direction of the relationship

Correlation:
- corr(X,Y) = cov(X,Y) / (σ_X*σ_Y), Where σ_X and σ_Y are the standard deviations of X and Y respectively.
- Measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship. 
- Provides a standardized measure of the relationship
- Values range from -1 to +1
- Not affected by changes in scale
- Easier to interpret, with -1 indicating perfect negative correlation, 0 indicating no correlation, and +1 indicating perfect positive correlation
- Standardized version of covariance
- More commonly used in practice
- Easier to compare relationships between different pairs of variables


In summary, while both measure the relationship between variables, correlation provides a standardized, easily interpretable measure of both strength and direction, making it more widely used in practical applications.
